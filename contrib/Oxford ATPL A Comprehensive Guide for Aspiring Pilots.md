One of the most popular and reputable ways to obtain an ATPL is through the Oxford ATPL programme offered by CAE, a global leader in aviation training. The Oxford ATPL programme is an integrated course that takes students with little or no previous flying experience and prepares them for a career at an airline right after graduation. The programme consists of three phases: ground school, flight training and type rating.
 
In the ground school phase, students learn the theoretical knowledge required for the ATPL exams. The Oxford ATPL programme covers 14 subjects, such as Air Law, Meteorology, Navigation, Principles of Flight and more. The subjects are taught using a combination of classroom lectures, computer-based training (CBT) and interactive eBooks. The CBTs are designed to enhance the learning experience with animations, simulations and quizzes. The eBooks are downloadable PDF files that can be viewed on any device capable of viewing PDFs. The eBooks are based on the EASA 2016 syllabus NPA29 Revision and comply with the ATPL learning objectives published by EASA.
 
In the flight training phase, students gain practical flying skills in various aircraft and simulators. The Oxford ATPL programme uses a fleet of modern single-engine and multi-engine aircraft equipped with glass cockpits, such as the Diamond DA40 and DA42. The programme also uses state-of-the-art flight simulators that replicate the real-world scenarios and challenges faced by pilots. The flight training phase includes visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR) training, as well as multi-crew cooperation (MCC) and jet orientation course (JOC) training.
 
In the type rating phase, students learn how to operate a specific type of jet aircraft that they will fly for an airline. The Oxford ATPL programme offers type ratings for various popular aircraft types, such as the Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Embraer 170/190 and more. The type rating phase involves classroom instruction, CBTs and simulator sessions.
 
The Oxford ATPL programme is delivered at various CAE locations around the world, such as London Oxford Airport, London Gatwick Airport, Brussels Airport and Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. The programme duration varies depending on the location and the type rating chosen, but it typically ranges from 18 to 24 months.
 
The Oxford ATPL programme is not only a comprehensive and rigorous course that prepares students for the ATPL exams and airline operations, but also a gateway to employment opportunities with leading airlines. CAE has partnerships with over 300 airlines worldwide and provides placement support for its graduates. Some of the airlines that hire Oxford ATPL graduates include easyJet, Ryanair, CityJet, Volotea and more.

The eligibility requirements include being at least 18 years old, having a high school diploma or equivalent, having a good command of English and having a valid EASA Class 1 medical certificate.
