## Step 1: Download the Mod
  
The first thing you need to do is download the mod from a reliable source. You can find it on various websites and forums dedicated to Street Legal Racing Redline, such as [this YouTube playlist\[^2^\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLstcSESEFwiAuLZvyhr0U95-Y63N_YajJ) or [this YouTube video\[^1^\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnDuzxgo9P8). The mod is usually divided into several parts that you need to download separately.
  
Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive to store the mod files. The mod is about 3 GB in size, so you will need at least 5 GB of free space. You will also need a program that can extract compressed files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
  
## Step 2: Install the Mod
  
Once you have downloaded all the parts of the mod, you need to extract them to a folder on your computer. You can use any folder you want, but we recommend creating a new one specifically for the mod. For example, you can name it "SLRR by Jack".
  
To extract the files, right-click on the first part of the mod (usually named "SLRR by Jack V2.part01.rar") and select "Extract here" or "Extract to SLRR by Jack". The program will automatically extract all the other parts as well. You should end up with a folder that contains several subfolders and files.
  
Next, you need to install the mod to your Street Legal Racing Redline folder. If you don't have the original game installed on your computer, you can download it from [this YouTube video\[^3^\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95OaCd4-l00). The game is about 1 GB in size, so make sure you have enough space for it as well.
  
To install the mod, simply copy and paste all the subfolders and files from the "SLRR by Jack" folder to your Street Legal Racing Redline folder. You can find this folder in your Program Files directory (usually C:\Program Files\Street Legal Racing - Redline). If you are asked to overwrite any existing files, click "Yes" or "Replace". This will ensure that the mod replaces the original game files with its own.
  
## Step 3: Play the Mod
  
Now that you have installed the mod, you are ready to play it. To launch the game, double-click on the "StreetLegal\_Redline.exe" file in your Street Legal Racing Redline folder. You should see a new splash screen with
