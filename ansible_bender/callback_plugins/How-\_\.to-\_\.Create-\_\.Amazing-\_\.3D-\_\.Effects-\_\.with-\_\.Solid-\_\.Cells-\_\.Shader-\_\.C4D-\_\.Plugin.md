In this article, we will show you how to use the Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin to create some amazing 3D effects. We will also share some tips and tricks to optimize your workflow and get the best results.
 
## What is Solid Cells Shader C4D Plugin?
 
Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin is a Cinema 4D plugin that generates procedural textures based on Voronoi diagrams. Voronoi diagrams are mathematical models that divide a space into regions based on the distance to a set of points. Each region is called a cell and has a unique color and value.
 
The Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin uses these Voronoi diagrams to create realistic cell-like textures that can be applied to any 3D object. You can control the size, shape, color, and distribution of the cells, as well as the blending mode, noise, and displacement of the texture. You can also layer multiple textures to create complex and varied effects.
 
The Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin is compatible with Cinema 4D R20 and above. You can download it from [here](https://www.c4dzone.com/en/shop/plug-ins-17/solid-cells-shader-1-0-262.htm) for â¬25.
 
## How to Use Solid Cells Shader C4D Plugin?
 
To use the Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new material in Cinema 4D and open the Material Editor.
2. Under the Color channel, click on the Texture button and select Solid Cells Shader from the list.
3. A new window will open where you can adjust the parameters of the Solid Cells Shader. You can change the Cell Size, Cell Variation, Cell Shape, Cell Color, Cell Seed, Cell Blending Mode, Cell Noise, Cell Displacement, and Cell Bump.
4. You can also add more layers of Solid Cells Shader by clicking on the Add Layer button at the bottom of the window. You can change the order and opacity of each layer by dragging them up or down.
5. Once you are happy with your texture, click OK to close the window and apply the material to your 3D object.
6. You can also use other channels such as Specular, Reflection, Alpha, etc. to enhance your texture further.

## Tips and Tricks for Using Solid Cells Shader C4D Plugin
 
Here are some tips and tricks for using the Solid Cells Shader C4D plugin:

- To create realistic skin effects, use a small cell size with a high cell variation and a low cell shape. Use warm colors for the cell color and a soft light blending mode. Add some noise and displacement to create pores and wrinkles.
- To create realistic blood effects, use a large cell size with a low cell variation and a high cell shape. Use red colors for the cell color and a multiply blending mode. Add some noise and bump to create bubbles and clots.
- To create realistic wood effects, use a medium cell size with a medium cell variation and a low cell shape. Use brown colors for the cell color and a normal blending mode. Add some noise and displacement to create rings and cracks.
- To create realistic marble effects, use a small cell size with a low cell variation and a high cell shape. Use white colors for the cell color and a screen blending mode. Add some noise and bump to create veins and patterns.
- To create more abstract and artistic effects, experiment with different combinations of parameters and layers. You can also use different projection modes such as UVW Mapping, Spherical Mapping, Cubic Mapping 0f148eb4a0
